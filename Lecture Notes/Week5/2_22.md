---

Below is a guide to a very minimal baseline. Note that we expect it to be customized to work for YOUR project idea. Also, we expect you to do more than the minimal - and you will be graded on effort put in

  1. Break up work
    - meet with team members and decide
      - what your team is going to do for the demo
      - who is working on server and on client
      - each person must have a list of things to show the TA for the combined team demo#2 (can't be separate demos)

  2. Android - How to get started
    - PHASE-1 (use jsontest.com)
      - Think of ONE screen which takes in input and displays some results
      - Play with volley to connect to jsontest.com
      - Connect screen code to volley to connect to jsontest.com and display results
      - Debug and fix and re-check as needed

    - PHASE-2 (use Postman server)
      - Get postman server to work
      - Connect your AS code to postman server and check to see it works
      - Debug and fix and re-check as needed

    - PHASE-3 (use localhost for H2 db)
      - Download, build, run your team-server using H2 db on LOCALHOST
      - Connect your AS code to postman server and check to see it works

    - PHASE-4 (use remote host)
      - When your remote server is running, connect your AS code to the remote server and check to see it works
      - Debug and fix and re-check as needed

    - PHASE-5 (Android Client)
      - WOrk with your Android teammembers to make sure that
