## Regression Testing

When a change is made to a program (either to add a new feature or to fix a bug), often some things that used to work before do not work anymore! This has **huge cost implications** if the system is released to users

To avoid his problem, a set of tests are always run when changes are made to make sure that what used to work -- still works! This process is known as REGRESSION TESTING. This prevents code from regressing (i.e. going backwards)
